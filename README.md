# Notes on data
## CSV Files included
    1. household data
    2. location data
    3. person data
    4. Trips data
    5. vehicles data

## Labelling
Try labeling values using thsc-nhts17-caltranscodebook.xlsx
Understand the data using the dictionary tsdc-nhts17-caltrans-datadictionary.pdf

## Missing Values
Missing values are coded lile -9,-8,-7, etc. Check you are labelling correctly

## Instructions
1 Importing and understanding the data
2 Examples of data aggregations between multiple variables (summaries for different levels of categorical variables)
3 Cross-tabulations and frequency tests for chosen variables
4 Recoding values into new values (e.g. adding labels to numberic data) and converting character/categorical data into factors and ordered factors
5 Screening and dealing with missing or unusual values (e.g. extreme/outliers)
6 Efficient merging/joining datasets by common column(s)
7 Visualizing data using gglplot2 (editing parameters, applying labels, adding annotations, etc)
8 (extra) Visualizing data using interactive plots

## Topics to explore
1 Distinguish between person trips and vehicle trips
2 Purspose of travel: Distinguish between commute, education, business, personal and other
3 Trips by time of day (e.g. AM/PM, peak/non-peak, nightime)
4 Mode of transport (e.g. single-occupancy, 2-person car, wakl, transit, bike, etc)
